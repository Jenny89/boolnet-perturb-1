    "In a discrete regulatory network the value of a node $n$ in $t+1$ is a function of the values of its regulators in the time $t. However, we can [update the value of the nodes in different ways](http://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2014/10/19/010504.full.pdf). The two most common are synchronous -where all nodes are updated at the same time- and asynchronous -where the nodes are updated one by one.\n",
