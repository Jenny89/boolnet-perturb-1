    "Organisms develop in a changing world where they are subject to both intrisic noise and a perturbations of the environment. They need to be both resilient and capable of altering their phenotype depending of the circumstances. This two behaivors coexist in living beings, which indicates that there is a common mechanism that underlies both robustness and plasticity\\cite{Wagner?}. Gene Regulatory Networks are a usefull tool for studing the robustness and plasticity of biological systems in response to different kinds of perturbations."

    "Gene regulatory Networks (GRN)  are deterministic dynamic systems. GRN have been used to study the differentiation, robustness and plasticity of developmental processes in different organisms\\cite{}. \n",
    "GRN consist of nodes -that can be genes, proteins, biochemical or even biological processes- and edges -that represent the regulatory interactions among the nodes. Using this interactions it is possible to construct functions that describe the state of the nodes, this means, wether the gene or protein is active or inactive. \n",

    "In this work we will study the Th17/iTreg regulatory network. CD4 + T cells are fundamental for the adaptive immune response. They integrate the signals of the environment and differentiate into different cell types (Th1, Th2, Th17, iTreg, etc), which activate different parts of the inmune system. In particular, Th17 cells have been associated with the inflammation and iTreg cells with the regulation of the inflamatory response.\n",
    "CD4+ T cells begin as na√Øve Th0 cells, which do not express a transcription factor. These cells are activated by antigen presentation and differentiate into different cell types depending in the cytokines in the environment. In the presence of IL-6 or IL-21 and TGF$\\beta$ Th0 cells differentiate into Th17 cells and express ROR$\\gamma$t, IL-21 and IL-17. In the presence of IL-2 and TGF$\\beta$ Th0 cells differentiate into iTreg cells and express Foxp3 and TGF$\\beta$. Interleukin-10 (IL-10) is a regulatory cytokine that is expressed in multiple cell types, it is activated by various cytokines including IL-6, IL-21 and TGF$\\beta$. These cytokines and transcription factors regulate each other and their relationships can be vizualized a as graph.\n",
